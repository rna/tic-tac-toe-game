### About Game

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

#### Game rules
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. You are X, your opponent is O. Players take turns putting their marks in numbered squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
